# Image-style-Transfer
This project transforms ordinary images into captivating works of art by applying diverse artistic styles. It takes a real image and imbues it with the essence of different artistic techniques, giving it a unique and compelling appearance while retaining the core content. It essentially empowers images with a touch of artistic mastery. The approach is borrowed from "Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge" published on CVPR 2016.
